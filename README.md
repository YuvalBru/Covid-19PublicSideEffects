# Covid - 19 Side Effects Diagnosis Supervised Learning Classification and Unsupervised Learning analysis.
In this project as a part of the course Advanced Topics In Machine Learning our lecturer is Dr. Chen Hajaj. We take an Israeli Public dataset from https://data.gov.il/dataset/vacseffect which describes side effects people experienced as a result of the covid-19 vaccine or booster and their diagnosis which was provided by doctors according to the answers of the questionnaire the people provided.

We continue to perform classification using advanced machine learning methods such as boosting and neural networks in order to classify wether or not a certain person has a diagnosis or doesn't have a diagnosis. We then continue to provide analysis on the data using DBSCAN and use methods like PCA to help us perform said analysis.
